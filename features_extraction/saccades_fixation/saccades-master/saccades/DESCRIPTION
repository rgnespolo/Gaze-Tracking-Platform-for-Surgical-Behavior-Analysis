Description: Functions for detecting eye fixations in raw sample-based
 eye-tracking data.  The detection is done using a velocity-based
 algorithm for saccade detection proposed by Ralf Engbert and Reinhold
 Kliegl.  The algorithm labels segments as saccades when the velocity
 of the eye movement exceeds a certain threshold.  Anything between
 two saccades is a fixation, a blink, or some artifact.  Simple
 heuristics are used to distinguish between these cases.  The
 algorithm is not appropriate for data containing episodes of smooth
 pursuit eye movements.
